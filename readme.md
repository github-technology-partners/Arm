## Integration Details

Together with GitHub we have built the following integrations:

1. **Native Arm Runners for GitHub Actions**:

The GitHub Arm-hosted runners offer significant benefits for developers:

Native performance: Execute your build and test cycles directly on Arm Neoverse-based processors. This eliminates the overhead and complexities tied to instruction emulation and cross-compilation.
Integrated Workflow:  Experience a seamless integration within the familiar GitHub Actions environment, making your development process more straightforward.
Cost-effectiveness: Enjoy the convenience and cost savings that come with the GitHub hosted runner infrastructure.
Arm Linux and Windows runners are now [generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-09-03-github-actions-arm64-linux-and-windows-runners-are-now-generally-available/) in Teams and Enterprise Accounts ... 

AND ... [free in public reposities](https://github.blog/changelog/2025-01-16-linux-arm64-hosted-runners-now-available-for-free-in-public-repositories-public-preview/) (Private Preview)!!

2. **The Arm Extendion for GitHub Copilot**:

Soon to be available as part of the GitHub marketplace, GitHub Copilot Arm extensions help developers build, test, and deploy software more efficiently, increasing productivity and impact. The extensions, integrated with curated datasets, offer specialized tools for AI code development such as code migration, containerization, CI/CD workflows, and performance optimization, helping to ensure a smooth cloud to edge deployment experience.
